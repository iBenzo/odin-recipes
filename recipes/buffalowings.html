        <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®), or to taste</li>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <div class="para">
        <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.      </li>
        <li>Mix together flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange onto a large plate with space between. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 9 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
      </div>
    </ol>
